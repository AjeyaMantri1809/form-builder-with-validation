# form-builder-with-validation
A web application built using Javascript, HTML5 and CSSm which can be used to create various types of forms. These forms can be created using the provided templates, or through the custom form builder which contains the most commonly used fields. Feel free to use this code in your own projects and applications.

Each form also has in-built client-side form validation to ensure data inputted by user matches the requirements for each field. The validation is conducted using standardized rules. To implement custom rules will require a basic understanding of HTML and Java Script. More information can be found at https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp.
